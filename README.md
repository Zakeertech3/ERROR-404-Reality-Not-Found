## 🎨 The Story

A 25-panel visual narrative following Kai, a 17-year-old anime protagonist with electric cyan hair, through a morning where reality literally crashes like a Windows XP system.

**Act 1 (Panels 1-8):** Morning glitches begin - toothpaste freezes, coffee mugs turn into wireframe 3D models, his face pixelates in the mirror.

**Act 2 (Panels 9-18):** Reality fragments - dogs become untextured models, buses freeze mid-air with Windows Update dialogs, social interactions require admin privileges.

**Act 3 (Panels 19-25):** He opens Task Manager and finds "Reality.exe (Not Responding) - 99% CPU". After a Blue Screen of Death and Safe Mode reboot, the camera pulls back to reveal the twist: **Kai was at a computer the whole time.** His mouse hovers over "Exit Game" with the caption *"Runtime: 1 life"*.
